        Less greenhouse gases in the air, more nutrients in the soil.
        <ul> Example: 
        <li> 100 tons food waste per year will give: </li>
        <li> 4 500 m3 biogas per year; </li>
        <li> 98 tons organic fertilizer per year; </li>
        <li> 10.77 tons CO2 compensation per year for electricity feed-in. </li>
        </ul>
